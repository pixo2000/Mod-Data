Factory is plug and play, but if you just connect all inputs and power, it will stabilize itself 6-7 hours to get
Best starting scenario is to connect all inputs and power, but keep output disconnected. Due to manifold and a lot of internal storages,
it will take almost 3 hours, until all machines will stop working due to full internal storage. Now it is time to connect output belt,
it will last few minutes, until internal buffers will be flushed and then all machines will works with 100% ratio and keep output per minute mentioned above.
